# MATLIB
Matrix math library, the way that I want it.

## MATRICES
Produce matrices with the class matrix.

## Complex Numbers
Produce complex numbers with the class cdouble.

## TODO
# Make a matrix element interpreter to simplify matrix specification
# Produce a basic matrix algebra interpreter so that calculations could be done in console

## POTENTIAL IDEAS
# Produce matrix class which has data stored in a file rather than in memory
