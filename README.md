# MATLIB
Matrix math library, the way that I want it.

## MATRICES
Produce matrices with the class matrix. Currently, the matrix elements are floats; however, this will likely change to a template. The variable members of this class consist of the elements themselves and the two numbers representing the size of the matrix.

## Complex Numbers
Produce complex numbers with the class cfloat. Objects of this class have two floats as elements and a boolean which determines whether the number is in rectangular or polar form. The default is rectangular.
